### Explanation of the HTML:

1. **`.box`**:

   - A `<div>` with a fixed width and height in pixels (`300px` by `150px`).
   - The text is centered both horizontally and vertically using `text-align: center` and `line-height: 150px`.

2. **`.print-page`**:

   - A `<div>` sized to mimic a standard paper size (`8.5in` by `11in`).
   - The text is centered vertically using `line-height: 11in`.

3. **`.margin-example`**:
   - A `<div>` with margins and padding defined in centimeters (`2cm` margin and `1cm` padding).
   - The text is centered horizontally using `text-align: center`.

### How to Test:

1. Copy the code into an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Open the file in a browser to see the examples in action.
3. Resize the browser window to observe how the elements behave (e.g., the `.box` and `.print-page` will remain fixed in size, while the `.margin-example` will adjust based on the screen size).

This example demonstrates how to use **absolute units** (`px`, `in`, `cm`) in real-world scenarios. Let me know if you need further clarification! ðŸ˜Š
