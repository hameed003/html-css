      How pixel ( px )and percentage ( % ) unit works, When an element is
      positioned absolutely.
    </h1>
    <p>
      When an element is positioned absolutely, its position is determined
      relative to its closest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing
      block ( body ) if no positioned ancestor is found ).
    </p>

    <!-- Example 1 -->
    <h3>Pixel unit ( px )</h3>
    <p>
      When you use pixel (px) units for positioning an absolutely positioned
      element, the element will be positioned a fixed number of pixels from the
      top, bottom, left, or right of its containing block. For example, top:
      20px; will position the element 20 pixels from the top of its containing
      block.
    </p>
    <div class="box1" id="div-1">1</div>
    <div id="container1">
      <div class="box1" id="div-2">2</div>
    </div>
    <div class="box1" id="div-3">3</div>
    <hr />

    <!-- Example 2 -->
    <h3>Percentage unit ( % )</h3>
    <p>
      When you use percentage (%) units for positioning an absolutely positioned
      element, the element will be positioned a percentage of the height or
      width of its containing block. For example, top: 50%; will position the
      element vertically at 50% of the height of its containing block.
    </p>
    <div class="box2" id="div-4">4</div>
    <div id="container2">
      <div class="box2" id="div-5">5</div>
    </div>
    <div class="box2" id="div-6">6</div>

    <hr />

    <!-- Example 3 -->
    <h1>
      What if no top, bottom, right, or left properties are assigned to an
      absolutely positioned element.
    </h1>
    <div class="box2" id="div-7">7</div>
    <p>
      If no top, bottom, right, or left properties are assigned to an absolutely
      positioned element, the element will be positioned at the default location
      based on the normal document flow. This means that the element will be
      positioned where it would normally appear in the document, but it will be
      taken out of the normal document flow and positioned absolutely relative
      to its closest positioned ancestor.
